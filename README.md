# Ethereum Hackathon Prep: ETHIndia 2024

Welcome to my **Ethereum Hackathon Prep** project for **ETHIndia 2024**! This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey and project development in preparation for the hackathon. Over the next 15 days, Iâ€™ll be diving into a range of Ethereum-based technologies, tools, and frameworks.

## ðŸš€ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn and practice the fundamentals of Ethereum development.
- Gain familiarity with key tools, technologies, and protocols mentioned in the ETHIndia hackathon.
- Build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage these technologies.

I will document my learning process, the resources I use, and the small projects I build along the way.

## ðŸ“… Learning Plan

Here is the plan for the next 15 days to cover the key technologies and concepts for ETHIndia:
